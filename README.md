# Statistics and Data Analysis Practicals üìä

Welcome to my repository for statistics practicals\! This collection contains all my lab work, assignments, and projects completed as part of my statistics coursework. Each practical focuses on applying theoretical concepts to datasets using modern data analysis tools.

-----

## üìã Practicals Overview

This repository is organized by practical number. Below is a list of all the assignments included.

  * **Practical 01: Descriptive Statistics**

      * **Description:** This practical covers the fundamentals of descriptive statistics. I calculated measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation) and created visualizations like histograms and box plots to understand data distributions.
      * **File:** `[Practical_01.ipynb](./path/to/your/Practical_01.ipynb)`

  * **Practical 02: Hypothesis Testing**

      * **Description:** This assignment focuses on inferential statistics. I performed t-tests and Chi-Square tests to validate hypotheses, interpreted p-values, and calculated confidence intervals to draw conclusions from sample data.
      * **File:** `[Practical_02.ipynb](./path/to/your/Practical_02.ipynb)`

  * **Practical 03: Linear Regression**

      * **Description:** In this practical, I built a simple linear regression model to explore the relationship between two variables. The analysis includes model training, prediction, and evaluation using metrics like R-squared.
      * **File:** `[Practical_03.ipynb](./path/to/your/Practical_03.ipynb)`

  * ***... (Add a new entry for each practical you complete)***

## üß† Key Concepts Covered

Throughout these practicals, I have applied a wide range of statistical methods, including:

  - Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
  - Probability Distributions
  - Data Visualization (Histograms, Scatter Plots, Bar Charts)
  - Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-Square)
  - Correlation and Regression Analysis
  - Confidence Intervals

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

The analyses in this repository were primarily conducted using **Python** and the following libraries:

  - **pandas:** For data manipulation and wrangling.
  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations and computations.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
  - **SciPy:** For scientific and statistical functions.
  - **scikit-learn:** For machine learning and regression models.

## üöÄ How to Use

To run any of the practicals on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the practical's directory.
3.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (you can create a `requirements.txt` file for convenience).
4.  Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) to see the code, analysis, and outputs.
